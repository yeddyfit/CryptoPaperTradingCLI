# Crypto Paper Trading CLI (Ruby)
A basic ruby CLI that allows for cross session paper trading, with user profiling. <br>
Uses limited buy/sell information from the BTCMarkets API (does not require token).
Currently is limited to only a few currencies, but can easily be extended. 
<br>


Start program by executing 'control.rb'.

NOTE: requires the gems tty-prompt, terminal-table, and http-part.
